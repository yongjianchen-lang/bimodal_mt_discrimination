# From Shortcuts to Balance: Attribution Analysis of Speech-Text Feature Utilization in Distinguishing Original from Machine-Translated Texts

**Authors: Yongjian Chen, Antonio Toral**

This repository contains the code and dataset for our EMNLP 2025 paper **From Shortcuts to Balance: Attribution Analysis of Speech-Text Feature Utilization in Distinguishing Original from Machine-Translated Texts**.

## Abstract

Neural text-based models for detecting machine-translated texts can rely on named entities (NEs) as classification shortcuts. While masking NEs encourages learning genuine translationese signals, it degrades the classification performance. Incorporating speech features compensates for this loss, but their interaction with NE reliance requires careful investigation. Through systematic attribution analysis across modalities, we find that bimodal integration leads to more balanced feature utilization, reducing the reliance on NEs in text while moderating overemphasis attribution patterns in speech features.
